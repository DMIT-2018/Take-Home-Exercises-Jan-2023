<summary>Simple Aggregates Caught All</summary>

**Given a list of Products, return a single result.**

* Count
* Min Price 
* Max Price
* Average Price
* Total Price (This is assuming that someone bought one of each thing.)
* **We only want to see those products that have are not discontinued**

  ```cs
Products
	.Select(x => new
	{
		Count = Products
					.Where(x => x.Discontinued == false)
					.Count(),
		MinPrice = Products
					.Where(x => x.Discontinued == false)
					.Min(x => x.UnitPrice),
		MaxPrice = Products
					.Where(x => x.Discontinued == false)
					.Select(x => x.UnitPrice).Max(),
		AveragePrice = Products
					.Where(x => x.Discontinued == false)
					.Average(x => x.UnitPrice),
		TotalPrice = Products
					.Where(x => x.Discontinued == false)
					.Select(x => x.UnitPrice).Sum()
	}
)
.FirstOrDefault()
.Dump();

  ```cs
Suppliers
.Select(s => new
{
	Name = s.CompanyName,
	ProductCount = Products
				.Where(p => p.SupplierID == s.SupplierID)
				.Count()
}).OrderByDescending(x => x.ProductCount)
.ThenBy(x => x.Name)
.Dump();
 ```

  ```cs
void Main()
{
	Suppliers
	.OrderBy(s => s.CompanyName)
	.Select(s => new
	{
		Name = s.CompanyName,
		History = Products
					.Where(p => p.SupplierID == s.SupplierID)
					.Select(p => new HistoryView()
					{
						Name = p.ProductName,
						QuantitySold = OrderDetails
						.Where(od => od.ProductID == p.ProductID)
						.Sum(od => od.Quantity)

					}).OrderByDescending(x => x.QuantitySold)
	})
	.Dump();
}

public class HistoryView
{
	public string Name { get; set; }
	public int? QuantitySold { get; set; }
}
 ```
