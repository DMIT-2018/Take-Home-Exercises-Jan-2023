<summary>Advance Anonymous Dataset using Ternary Operator & Aggregate Operator</summary>

**Given a list of Address, return the following information:** </br>
  * Address ID 
  * Name 
    * Use the ternary operator and the navigation property to get one of the following data values.  You will also needs to use the .any aggregate
